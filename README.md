# k6 - WoLT

Personal journey of ~1 week of Load Testing with [k6](https://k6.io/).

I have divided my exploration of k6 in 3 sections:
- [k6](./k6): Experiences using k6 binary/Docker image from my local machine.
- [k6 Cloud](./k6-cloud/): Experiences using k6 Cloud.
- [k6 Ext](./k6-ext/): Experiences extending k6 functionality.
